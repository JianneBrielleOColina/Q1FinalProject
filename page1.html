               <div class="wawawa">

                   <p>VAW is often caused by the belief that men are more powerful than women. This idea comes from old-fashioned ways of thinking about gender roles. Men are usually seen as the leaders and providers, while women are seen as caregivers and supporters. This imbalance of power can lead to violence against women as a way for men to control them.
